# Bank Queue Simulation in C

## Description
This project implements a Bank Queue Simulation using a circular queue data structure in C. It simulates the process of customers arriving at a bank and being served in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) manner. The program allows adding customers to the queue (enqueue) and serving/removing them (dequeue), while keeping track of the total number of customers arrived and served.

## Features
- *Circular Queue Implementation*: Uses a circular queue to manage customers efficiently.
- *Enqueue Operation*: Add customers to the queue with a unique token number.
- *Dequeue Operation*: Serve and remove the customer who arrived first.
- *Queue Status Tracking*: Displays total customers arrived and served.
- *Interactive Menu*: Simple command-line interface for user interaction.
- *Final Summary*: Provides a summary of total customers arrived and served upon exit.

## Installation and Compilation
To compile and run this project, you need a C compiler like GCC installed on your system.

1. Clone or download the project files.
2. Open a terminal in the project directory.
3. Compile the code using GCC:
   
   gcc module3.c -o bank_simulation
   
4. Run the executable:
   
   ./bank_simulation
   

## Usage
1. Run the compiled executable.
2. Choose from the menu options:
   - Enter 1 to add a customer (enqueue).
   - Enter 2 to serve a customer (dequeue).
   - Enter 3 to exit the program.
3. Follow the prompts to enter customer token numbers when adding customers.
4. View the queue operations and final summary upon exit.
