Queue Simulation Bank in C

A simple and clear simulation of a bank customer queue using a Circular Queue in C.
The project models how customers arrive, wait, and get served in a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) manner—just like a real bank.


---

🚀 Project Overview

This program allows customers to be added to a queue, served from the front, and removed once completed.
It also maintains statistics such as:

Total customers arrived

Total customers served


This project was created under Project-Based Learning (PBL) for strengthening core data structure concepts.

Understand queue overflow and underflow

Practice menu-driven programming in C



---

✨ Key Features

Add customer with a token number

Serve first-come customer

Tracks arrival & service count

Circular queue for memory efficiency
